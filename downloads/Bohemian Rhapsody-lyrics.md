{ 0:02 }Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
{ 0:09 }Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
{ 0:16 }Open your eyes, look up to the skies and { 0:23 }see
{ 0:26 }I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
{ 0:32 }Because I'm easy come, easy go
{ 0:37 }Little high, little low
{ 0:40 }Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter { 0:46 }to me, { 0:50 }to me{ 0:52 }
{ 0:57 }Mama,{ 1:00 } just killed a man
{ 1:03 }Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead{ 1:10 }
{ 1:11 }Mama,{ 1:13 } life had just begun{ 1:17 }
{ 1:18 }But now I've gone and thrown it { 1:20 }all away
{ 1:24 }Mama, ooh,{ 1:30 } didn't mean to make you cry
{ 1:34 }If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
{ 1:38 }Carry on, carry on{ 1:43 } as if nothing really matters{ 1:46 }
{ 1:56 }Too late,{ 1:58 } my time has come{ 2:02 }
{ 2:03 }Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
{ 2:10 }Goodbye,{ 2:11 } everybody, I've got to go
{ 2:16 }Gotta leave you all behind and { 2:19 }face the truth{ 2:23 }
{ 2:24 }Mama,{ 2:26 } ooh{ 2:30 }
{ 2:31 }I don't wanna { 2:32 }die
{ 2:34 }I sometimes wish I'd never been born at { 2:37 }all{ 2:38 }
{ 3:08 }I see a little silhouetto of a man
{ 3:11 }Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
{ 3:14 }Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
{ 3:17 }(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
{ 3:24 }But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
{ 3:27 }He's just a poor boy from a poor family
{ 3:30 }Spare him his life from this monstrosity{ 3:33 }
{ 3:36 }Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?{ 3:38 }

{ 3:39 }No, we will not let you go (let him go){ 3:42 }
{ 3:43 }We will not let you go (let him go){ 3:45 }
{ 3:46 }We will not let you go (let me go)
{ 3:48 }Will not let you go (let me go)
{ 3:49 }Will not let you go (never, never, never, never let me { 3:52 }go)
{ 3:53 }No, no, no, no, no, no, no
{ 3:56 }Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
{ 3:57 }Mamma mia, let me go
{ 3:59 }Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,{ 4:03 } for me,{ 4:05 } for { 4:07 }me{ 4:09 }

{ 4:17 }So you think you can stone me and spit in my { 4:20 }eye?{ 4:21 }
{ 4:22 }So you think you can love me and leave me to { 4:26 }die?{ 4:27 }
{ 4:28 }Oh, { 4:29 }baby,{ 4:31 } can't do this to me, { 4:32 }baby
{ 4:34  }Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here{ 4:38 }

{ 4:37 }Ooh
{ 5:02 }Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah{ 5:04 }
{ 5:13 }Nothing really matters, anyone can see
{ 5:20 }Nothing really matters{ 5:23 }
{ 5:25 }Nothing really matters { 5:27 }to me
{ 5:32 }
