{ 0:11 }Slip inside the eye of your mind
{ 0:15 }Don't you know you might find
{ 0:19 }A better place to play?{ 0:21 }
{ 0:23 }You said that you'd never been
{ 0:27 }But all the things that you've seen
{ 0:31 }Will slowly fade { 0:32 }away{ 0:33 }
{ 0:35 }So I start a revolution from { 0:38 }my bed{ 0:39 }
{ 0:40 }'Cause you said the brains I had went to { 0:43 }my head{ 0:45 }
{ 0:47 }Step outside, summertime's { 0:49 }in bloom{ 0:51 }
{ 0:52 }Stand up beside the fireplace
{ 0:55 }Take that look from off your face
{ 0:58 }You ain't ever gonna burn my heart { 1:02 }out{ 1:06 }
{ 1:10 }And { 1:10 }so{ 1:12 } Sally can wait
{ 1:14 }She knows it's too late
{ 1:16 }As we're walking on { 1:19 }by{ 1:20 }
{ 1:20 }Her { 1:21 }soul{ 1:23 } slides away { 1:26 }
{ 1:27 }But don't look back in anger
{ 1:30 }I heard you say { 1:32 }

{ 1:42 }Take me to the place where you go
{ 1:46 }Where nobody knows
{ 1:50 }If it's night or day{1:52}
{ 1:54 }But please don't put your life in the hands
{ 1:58 }Of a rock and roll band
{ 2:01 }Who'll throw it all away{ 2:03 }
{ 2:05 }I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
{ 2:11 }'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
{ 2:18 }Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
{ 2:23 }Stand up beside the fireplace
{ 2:26 }Take that look from off your face
{ 2:29 }'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out { 2:36 }

{ 2:41 }And { 2:41}so{ 2:42} Sally can wait
{ 2:45 }She knows it's too late
{ 2:47 }As she's walking on { 2:50 }by{ 2:51 }
{ 2:52 }My { 2:53 }soul{ 2:55 } slides away{ 2:56 }
{ 2:57 }But don't look back in anger
{ 3:00 }I heard you say{ 3:02 }

{ 3:39 }So{ 3:41} Sally can wait
{ 3:44 }She knows it's too late
{ 3:46 }As we're walking on { 3:48 }by{ 3:49 }
{ 3:50 }Her { 3:51 }soul{ 3:52 } slides away{ 3:55 }
{ 3:56 }But don't look back in anger
{ 3:59 }I heard you say{ 4:01 }

{ 4:02 }So Sally can wait
{ 4:07 }She knows it's too late
{ 4:09 }As she's walking on { 4:12 }by{ 4:13 }
{ 4:14 }My { 4:15 }soul{ 4:16} slides away
{ 4:20 }But don't look back in anger{ 4:22 }
{ 4:23 }Don't look back in anger{ 4:25 }
{ 4:28 }I heard you say{ 4:30 }

{ 4:37 }At least not today
{ 4:39 }
